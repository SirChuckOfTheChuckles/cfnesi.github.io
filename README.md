Hey, my name is Charles Nesi! 
I'm an EECS 494 student who worked with Max Scheske on this Metroid NES remake.

This remake was created using Unity, C#, and code generated from ChatGPT.

For this project, I primarily worked on the enemies, player movement, room camera settings/transition, and authentic enemy placement within the game.
I also briefly experimented with tile-placements tools and some of the audio features in the game.

I also worked on a small 2D game called Lamplighter!

This game was made using Unity and C#. The player goes around various levels needing to manage their light in order to defeat enemies.
If the player runs out of light.... they need to find a campfire OR make a mad dash towards the end of the level.

The link is down below, I hope you enjoy playing it!

I am also on the dev team for the Starcraft II Archipelago mod, part of a randomizer that works across multiple games and can be heavily customizable!
