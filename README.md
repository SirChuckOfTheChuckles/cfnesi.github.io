Hey, my name is Charles Nesi! 
I'm a 494 student who worked with Max Scheske on this Metroid NES remake.

This remake was created using Unity, C#, and code generated from ChatGPT.

For this project, I primarily worked on the enemies, player movement, room camera settings/transition, and authentic enemy placement within the game.
I also briefly experimented with tile-placements tools and some of the audio features in the game.
